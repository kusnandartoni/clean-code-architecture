# clean-code-architecture
My personal opinion on how the Clean Code Architecture implementation looks like in `Go` within the context of the `Domain Driven Design` (DDD), yet i adopted some terms from the Onion Architecture such as `domain` in order to avoid any misleading interpretations with the `Domain` in `Domain Driven Design`.

I'm using `in-memory` repository for the current implementation, however... will be adding another sample for other repository implementations such as `database` and `web services`.
The client is also provided as a CLI application at this moment merely to show how this kinda architecture works. Absolutely, will be updating with other infrastructures and adapters such as REST APIs, gRPC services, etc.
