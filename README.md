# clean-code-architecture
My implementation version of Clean Code Architecture in the context of Domain Driven Design, yet i adopted some terms from Onion Architecture such as `domain` to avoid any misleading interpretations with the `domain` in `Domain Driven Design (DDD)`.

I'm using `in-memory` repository for the current implementation, however... will be adding another sample for other repository implementations such as `database` and `web services`.
The client is also provided as a CLI application at this moment. Absolutely, will be updating with other infrastructure and adapters such as REST APIs, gRPC services, etc.
